Welcome to PretendOS

If you are looking for a fast, performant, comprehensive and complete UI framework with draggable windows for you next project, then
this is NOT it. This is mostly just a pet project that I created for me to practice writing Javascript (while secretly wishing that
I was learning Rust instead). Please, if you need something that is actually usable, use ExtJS instead. I would consider this project
to be a rousing success if I were able to get even just a chuckle out of a much better developer than myself. I would event be
satisfied with a smile, or even just a little puff of air coming out of his or her nostrils. Also, this is NOT meant to be a
state management machine. I don't have a life, but I do have a wife and two kids, and a job that does not involve programming.
So I simply do not have the time to even begin to wrap my head around how to write something like that. Or a virtual DOM, for that matter.
To be hones, I would be surprised if anyone were ever to read this in the first place. But anyway, lets take a moment to mourn
everything that web developers are doing now once it all is inevitably replaced by WASM. *shrudder*

Ok, with that chilling thought out of the way, here's how to use this... thing?


Every element in PretendOS is based on HTML, CSS, and JS. I am not using the Canvas object because my brain is far too smooth for that.
I'm sure you understand. 


NOTE: I was thinking of naming this ImpostorSyndromeOS but I felt like it didn't roll off the tounge as well. Either way,
PretendOS is good because it can have the dual meaning of this pretending to be a framework and me pretending to be a developer.

NOTE: In my list of programming languages to learn, Markdown is pretty low in priority. Is it even type-safe?


NOTE: This framework is meant to be pretty opinionated... like my wife. Badum-tsss. (pls don't show her this)(love you bby <3).

NOTE: I'm a Primagen simp. Notice me senpai.


Right now a window is customzed by passing down variables. Eventually I will make it an object, because it will be too many
variables.
